# ACM_recsys_ML 2019
Mostly for the term project for TiA: Machine Learning at SNU spring 2019.
Will implement Factorization machine and some ANN (possibly RNN) solutions in addition to out own take on the problem.

## FM
Will be implemented as a tensorflow graph, in order to use tf.train.AdagradOptimizer. 
This is because the task given is to use that optimizer with some specific loss functions, BPR and TOP1.

## RNN
